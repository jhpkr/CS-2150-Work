arraysize = a (hex for 10)
int iterator = 0;
a for keeping track of where the array is
j = Max - 1 which is 9
tmp variable

have user input values into the array 
have the values be at the end of the code

1st for-loop: as long as arraysize - i > 0{
	2nd for-loop: as long as j - i > 0{
		A[j] - A[j-1] < 0 means [j-1] is greater 
		if [j-1] is greater: set tmp = variable
		A[j] = [j-1]
		[j-1] = tmp
	}
	increment i
}
